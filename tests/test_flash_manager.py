# Test for Issue #4: Failure to resolve new Katapult ID
# https://github.com/JohnBaumb/KlipperFleet/issues/4
#
# When a device reboots from Klipper firmware to Katapult bootloader,
# its USB device ID can change completely:
#   Before: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-infimech_tx_stm32f401xc_main_mcu-if00
#   After:  /dev/serial/by-id/usb-katapult_stm32f401xc_1A0028000A51333138373435-if00
#
# The fix uses a "snapshot and diff" approach to detect the new device.
